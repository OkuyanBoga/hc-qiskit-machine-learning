    This release includes the migration of a subset of Qiskit Algorithms features to Qiskit Machine Learning.
    This ensures continued enhancement of essential features for Qiskit Machine Learning following the end
    of official support for Qiskit Algorithms. Therefore, Qiskit Machine Learning will no longer depend on
    Qiskit Algorithms, possibly introducing breaking changes in import structures. Some quick-fixes are
    described below.

features:
  - |
    Migrated essential Qiskit Algorithms features to Qiskit Machine Learning:
    - `qiskit_algorithms/gradients` -> `qiskit_machine_learning/gradients`
    - `qiskit_algorithms/optimizers` -> `qiskit_machine_learning/optimizers`
    - `qiskit_algorithms/state_fidelities` -> `qiskit_machine_learning/state_fidelities`
    - Partial merge of `qiskit_algorithms/utils` with `qiskit_machine_learning/utils`
  - |
    Unit tests migrated accordingly:
    - `qiskit_algorithms/tests/gradients` -> `qiskit_machine_learning/tests/gradients`
    - `qiskit_algorithms/tests/optimizers` -> `qiskit_machine_learning/tests/optimizers`
    - `qiskit_algorithms/tests/state_fidelities` -> `qiskit_machine_learning/tests/state_fidelities`
    - Partial merge of `qiskit_algorithms/tests/utils` with `qiskit_machine_learning/tests/utils`

issues:
  - |
    Incorporating Qiskit Algorithms will facilitate the upgrade to newer versions of Qiskit and
    Qiskit Runtime. In particular, the following issues, still outstanding, will be tackled in the
    next release:
    - Support V2 primitives (#742)
    - Add support for EstimatorV2 to run circuits over hardware (#810)
  - |
    Compliance with ISA standards:
    - ISA circuit support for latest Runtime (#786)
    - Sampler fails to run FidelityKernel even if circuits are transpiled (#165)

upgrade:
  - |
    The merge of some of the features of Qiskit Algorithms into Qiskit Machine Learning might lead to breaking changes.
    For this reason, caution is advised when updating to version 0.8 during critical production stages in a project.
    Users must update their imports and code references in code that uses Qiskit Machine Leaning and Algorithms:
    - Change `qiskit_algorithms/gradients` to `qiskit_machine_learning/gradients`
    - Change `qiskit_algorithms/optimizers` to `qiskit_machine_learning/optimizers`
    - Change `qiskit_algorithms/state_fidelities` to `qiskit_machine_learning/state_fidelities`
    - Update utilities as needed due to partial merge.
    To continue using sub-modules and functionalities of Qiskit Algorithms that **have not been transferred**,
    you may continue using them as before by importing from Qiskit Algorithms. However, be aware that Qiskit Algorithms
    is no longer officially supported and some of its functionalities may not work in your use case. For any issues
    directly related to Qiskit Algorithms, please open a GitHub issue at https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms.
    Should you want to include a Qiskit Algorithms functionality that has not been incorporated in Qiskit Machine Learning,
    please open a feature-request issue at https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning, explaining why
    this change would be useful for you and other users.

deprecations:
  - |
    The following imports of Qiskit Algorithms modules into Qiskit Machine Learning are deprecated and their
    functionalities are now part of Qiskit Machine Learning itself:
    - `qiskit_algorithms/gradients`
    - `qiskit_algorithms/optimizers`
    - `qiskit_algorithms/state_fidelities`
    - Portions of `qiskit_algorithms/utils`
